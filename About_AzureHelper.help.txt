AzureHelper
Ths AzureHelper module is a set of useful PowerShell tools for use with Microsoft Azure.

Introduction
I use PowerShell with Azure a great deal and have created a number of useful functions etc for dealing with Azure. 
The functions help me - and you are welcome to use them. 

What this module contains
This module consists of a variety of useful things including functions, aliases, code fragments, 
demos, format files and about_ files. These artifacts were created to illustrate Azure with PowerShell 
in course teachings and in presentations and other documentation.
